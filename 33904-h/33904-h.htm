<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By John Ward Dean.</span></p>
<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The Committee on English Research of the New England Historic
Genealogical Society called attention in their last annual report to the
fact that there were in England many important documents relating to the
American colonies, as well as manuscript maps hitherto unknown to
historical investigators. They urged upon the society the desirability
of having exact copies of them made now while we have in Mr. Henry
Fitz-Gilbert Waters an experienced American antiquary resident in
London. This statement has been most strikingly verified by the recent
discovery by Mr. Waters of the Winthrop map&mdash;one of the most valuable
contributions yet made to our early colonial history&mdash;notices of which
appeared in the Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society for
June, 1884, and in the <span class="smcap">Register</span> for July, 1884
(xxxviii. 342).</p>

<p>The manuscript "Description of New England," which is here printed,
is a still more important discovery. Though it bears neither name nor
date, there is internal evidence that it was written in the year 1660,
after the return of Charles II., by Samuel Maverick, afterwards one of
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>king's
commissioners. Maverick, when Winthrop and his company arrived, was
settled at Noddle's Island, now East Boston, and was known to have been
here some years before. The date of his arrival in New England has
hitherto been unknown. This manuscript gives it as 1624. Maverick was
then about twenty-two years old.</p>

<p>An account of New England by one of the first white men who ever settled
on the shores of Massachusetts Bay, one of the "old planters" whom Gov.
Winthrop found here, is certainly of extraordinary interest to all
students of our colonial history. Its fortunate discovery emphasizes in
the strongest manner the great importance of the work which Mr. Waters
is doing for us in England.</p>

<p>This paper clears up many obscurities in our early New England history,
and gives us definite information which we have long desired to obtain.
It was probably presented to Sir Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of
Clarendon, who was then Charles the Second's Lord High Chancellor. It
may be the paper referred to by Maverick in his letter to the earl,
printed in the Collections of the New York Historical Society for 1869,
page 19. That letter and others in the same volume should be read in
connection with the present paper. They show the persistency displayed
by Maverick in his efforts to deprive New England, and particularly
Massachusetts, of the right of self-government which had so long been
enjoyed here. The same spirit is shown in his letters printed in the
third volume of the New York Colonial Documents. The death of Maverick,
which occurred between October 15, 1669, and May 15, 1676, did not bring
repose to the people of Massachusetts. In the latter year a new assailant
of their charter appeared in the person of Ed<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>ward Randolph (see
<span class="smcap">Register</span>, xxxvi. 155), whose assaults on their
liberties did not cease till the charter was wrested from them, and the
government under it came to an end May 20, 1686.</p>

<p>The document here printed is in the British Museum, Egerton MSS. 2395,
ff. 397-411. The volume containing it was in private hands till 1875,
when on the sixteenth of February in that year it was sold at auction by
Messrs. Sotheby &amp; Co., London, and bought by the Trustees of the British
Museum.</p>

<p>The long residence of Mr. Maverick, the writer of this "Description of
New England," on these shores, and the opportunities which he is known
to have had to learn personally the facts here stated, give it greater
weight than it would have had were it merely the observations of a
transient visitor to the New World.</p>

<p>This document was read before the Massachusetts Historical Society by
John T. Hassam, A.M., in October, 1884, and is printed in its
Proceedings, vol. xxi. p. 231. It was also printed in the New-England
Historical and Genealogical Register for January, 1885, and the type set
for that periodical have been used to print the present issue.</p>

<h2>A BRIEFE DISCRIPTION OF NEW ENGLAND AND THE<br />
SEVERALL TOWNES THEREIN,</h2>

<p class="center"><b>TOGETHER WITH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT THEREOF.</b></p>


<p><i>Pem<span style="margin-left: -0.6em; letter-spacing: 0.25em">&#732;a</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.25em;">quid.</span></i>&mdash;Westward from Penobscott
(which is the Southermost Fort in Nova Scotia) fourteen Leagues of is
Pem<span style="margin-left: -0.6em; letter-spacing: 0.25em">&#732;a</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.25em;">quid.</span> in which River
Alderman Alworth of Bristole, setled a Company of People in the yeare
1625, which Plantation hath continued and many Families are now settled
there. There was a Patent granted for it by his Mat<sup>ies</sup>: Royall
Grandfath<sup>er</sup> and by vertue of that Patent they hold the Islands of
Monahegan and Damerells Coue, and other small ones adjacent Commodious
for fishing.</p>

<p><i>Sagadahocke.</i>&mdash;Three leagues distant from Damerells Coue is
Sagadahocke at the mouth of Kenebeth River, on which place the Lord
Pohams people setled about fiftie yeares since, but soon after deserted
it, and returned for England; I found Rootes and Garden hearbs and some
old walles there, when I went first over which shewed it to be the place
where they had been. This is a great and spreading River and runes very
neer into Canada. One Captaine Young and 3 men with him in the Yeare
1636 went up the River upon discovery and only by Carying their Canoes
some few times, and not farr by Land came into Canada River very neare
Kebeck Fort where by the French, Cap<sup>t</sup> Young was taken, and
carried for ffrance but his Company returned safe and about 10 yeares
since a Gentleman and a Fryer came down this way from Kebeck to us in
New England to desire aide from us ag<sup>st</sup> the Mowake Indians
who were and still are their deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
id="Page_8">8</a></span> enemies; This River by reason of its nearnesse
to Canada and some other branches of it tending towards Hudsons River;
and a Lake of Canada afford more Beaver skins and other peltry then any
other about us: On this River &amp; on the Islands lying on the mouth of
it are many families Scatteringly setled. Some attend wholly the trade
with the Indians, others planting and raiseing a stock of Cattle and
Some at the mouth of the River keep fishing. There was a patent granted
to Christo: Batchelo<sup>r</sup> and Company in the year 1632 or thereabouts
for the mouth of the River and some tract of land adjacent, who came over
in the Ship named the Plough, and termed themselves the Plough Companie,
but soon scattered some for Virginia some for England, some to the
Massachusetts never settling on that land.</p>

<p><i>Casco Bay.</i>&mdash;Betweene Sagadahocke and Cape Elizabeth lying
about 7 Leagues assunder is Casco Bay; about the yeare 1632 there was a
Patent granted to one Cap<sup>t</sup>. Christopher Lewett for 6000 acres
of land which he tooke up in this Bay neare Cape Elizabeth and built a
good House and fortified well on an Island lyeing before Casco River
this he sold and his Interrest in the Patent to M<sup>r</sup> Ceeley
M<sup>r</sup> Jope and Company of Plimouth, In this Casco Bay are many
scattering Families settled. There was a Patent granted for this Bay
some yeares since by the title of the Province of Ligonia to Collonell
Alexander Rigby afterwards a Judge, and under this Goverment the People
lived some yeares, till of late the Government of the Massachusits hath
made bold to stretch its Jurisdiction to the midle of this Bay, and as
lyeing in their way have taken in a dozen of Goverments more.</p>

<p><i>Richmond Island.</i>&mdash;There was long since a Patent granted
to M<sup>r</sup> Robert Trelawny of Plymouth from Cape Elizabeth to
Spurwinke River including all Richmond Isle, an Excellent ffishing place,
His Agents for matter of Goverment long since submitted to the Province
of Mayne, for which Province a Patent was long since granted to S<sup>r</sup>
Ferdinando Gorges there are not many people in it, Those that are, are
under the Goverment of the Massachusits.</p>

<p><i>Black Point.</i>&mdash;The next place inhabited is Black Point two
miles from Richmond Island; For this a Patent was granted to Captaine
Cammock whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
successor M<sup>r</sup> Henry Joselin lives there now, and severall
Families besides, they were under the Goverment of the Province of
Mayne, but now Commanded by the Massachusits.</p>

<p><i>Saco.</i>&mdash;Three miles beyond this is Saco River abounding
with ffish as Basse, Sturgeon and Salmond. The Northside of the River
was granted by Patent to M<sup>r</sup> Lewis and Capt. Bonithan, and the
Southside to on M<sup>r</sup> Richard Vines, upon this River are severall
Families setled formerly under the Goverment of the Province of Majne
and here was keept some time the Generall Court for that Province, but
now Commanded by the Massachusits.</p>

<p><i>Wells.</i>&mdash;Three miles from Saco River are Cape Porpyes
Islands a good ffishing place, where are Severall Families setled, and 4
miles from thence is Wells a handsome and well peopled place Lying on
both sides of a River, for which Place a Patent was long since Granted
to on M<sup>r</sup> John Stratton but now Commanded by the Massachusetts.</p>

<p><i>Bristoll</i> now <i>Yorke</i>.&mdash;About 12 miles further is the
River Agomentine, for which and the lands adjacent a Patent was (nere 30
yeares since) granted unto S<sup>r</sup> Ferdinando Gorges, M<sup>r</sup>
Godfrey, Alderman ffoote of Bristoll myselfe, and some others, On the
northside of this River at our great Cost and Charges wee setled many
ffamilies, which was then called Bristoll, and according to the Patent,
the Goverment was conformable to that of the Corporation of Bristoll,
only admitting of Appeales to the Generall Court for the Province of
Mayne which was often keept there, but some yeares since the Goverment
with the rest was Swallowed up by the Massachusetts.</p>

<p><i>Nichiquiwanick.</i>&mdash;About 3 miles from Agomentine is the River
Pascataway which is 6 miles from the mouth. It brancheth itselfe in two
Branches, the South branch of which retaineth the name of Pascataway the
other Nichiquiwanick, on the Northside of this River there are severall
Divisions of Land granted long since by Patents unto diverse persons as
Cap<sup>t</sup> Mason, Cap<sup>t</sup> Griffith, M<sup>r</sup> Gardener
and others, on which are severall persons setled for 12 miles togither.
At the Falls of Nichiquiwanick 3 Excellent Saw-Mills are seatted and
there and downward that side of y<sup>e</sup> River have been gotten most
of the Masts which have come for England, and amongst the rest that admired
Mast which came over some time last year containing neere 30 Tun<span

<p><i>Strawberry Bank. The Great House &amp; Isle of Shooles.</i>&mdash;Within
2 Myles of the Mouth is Strawberry Banke where are many Families, and a
Minister &amp; a Meeting House, and to the meeting Houses of Dower &amp;
Exceter, most of the people resort. This Strawberry Banke is part of
6000 acres granted by Patent about y<sup>e</sup> yeare 1620 or 1621, to
M<sup>r</sup> David Thompson, who with the assistance of M<sup>r</sup>
Nicholas Sherwill, M<sup>r</sup> Leonard Pomery and M<sup>r</sup> Abraham
Colmer of Plymouth Merchants, went ower with a Considerable Company of
Servants and built a Strong and Large House, enclosed it with a large
and high Palizado and mounted Gunns, and being stored extraordinarly
with shot and Ammunition was a Terror to the Indians, who at that time
were insulting over the poor weake and unfurnished Planters of Plymouth.
This house and ffort he built on a Point of Land at the very entrance of
Pascatoway River, And haveing granted by Patent all the Island bordering
on this land to the Midle of the River, he tooke possession of an Island
com<span style="margin-left: -0.6em; letter-spacing: 0.15em"><small>&#175;</small>o</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.2em;">nly</span> called the great Island and for
the bounds of this land he went up the River to a point called Bloudy
Point, and by the sea side about 4 milles he had also power of Goverment
within his owne bounds, Notwithstanding all this, all is at this day in

Hampton, The inhabitants living weell by Corne and Cattle, of which they
have great store, Ther was a Patent granted for this very place to
Cap<sup>t</sup> Mason neare 40 yeares agoe &amp; this was the first land
the Massachusits stretcht there line over beyond there true bounds: For
about 3 miles South of this place, at there first coming over they sett
up a house and named it the bound House as finding it three miles from
Meromack, the North bound of there Patent, and with this they rested

and this Towne, the River is broader then the Thames at Deptford, and in
the Sumer abounds with Sturgeon, Salmon and other ffresh water fish. Had
we the art of takeing and saveing the Sturgeon it would prove a very
great advantage, the Country affording Vinager, and all other Materialls
to do it withall.</p>

<p>In this Towne and old Newbury adjoining are 2 Meeting Houses.</p>

<p><i>Salem.</i>&mdash;On the South side of Salem River stands on a
peninsula the Towne of Salem, setled some yeares by a few people befor
the Patent of the Massachusits was granted. It is very commodious for
fishing, and many Vessells have been built there and (excep<sup>t</sup>
Boston) it hath as much Trade as any place in New England both inland

<p><i>Marblehead or Foy.</i>&mdash;Two miles below this Towne on the
Southside of the Harbo<sup>r</sup> by the sea side lyeth Marblehead or
ffoy the greatest Towne for ffishing in New England.</p>

<p><i>Lynne.</i>&mdash;Five miles Westward lyeth the Towne of Lynne along
by the sea side, and two miles aboue it within the bounds of it are the
greatest Iron works erected for the most part at the charge of some
Merchants, and Gentlmen here resideing and cost them about 14000£, who
were as it is conceived about six yeares since Injuriously outted of
them to the great prejudice of the Country and Owners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p><i>Reading.</i>&mdash;Three miles above the Iron Worke in the Country
is a pretty Towne, called Reading, which as all inland Townes doe live

digging of myne, and cutting of wood.</p>

<p><i>Rumney Marsh.</i>&mdash;Two miles from the Ironwork by the Seaside
is a large Marsh called Rummney Marsh and between that and Winnisime

<p><i>Winnisime.</i>&mdash;Two miles Sowth from Rumney Marsh on the
North side of Mistick River is Winnisime which though but a few houses
on it, yet deserves to be menc<span style="margin-left: -0.4em;
letter-spacing: 0.2em">&#732;</span><span style="margin-left: -0.2em;">ond</span>
One house yet standing there which is the Antientest house in the
Massachusetts Goverment, a house which in the yeare 1625 I fortified
with a Pillizado and fflankers and gunnes both belowe and above in them
which awed the Indians who at that time had a mind to Cutt off the
English, They once faced it but receiveing a repulse never attempted it
more although (as now they confesse) they repented it when about 2
yeares after they saw so many English come over.</p>

<p><i>Mauldon.</i>&mdash;Two miles above Winnisime Westward stands a
small Country Towne called Mauldon, who imploy themselves much in
ffurnishing the Towne of Boston and Charles Towne with wood, Timber and
other Materials to build withall.</p>

<p><i>Wooburne.</i>&mdash;Fower or five miles above Mouldon West is a more
considerable Towne called Wooburne, they live by ffurnishing the Sea
Townes with Provisions as Corne and Flesh, and also they ffurnish the
Merchants with such goods to be exported.</p>

River is the Towne of Charles Towne standing on the Northside of the
Mouth of Charles River, It Challengeth the second place of Antiquitie in
the Massachusetts Government. It hath some considerable Merchants in it
and many usefull handicraftsmen and many good farmers belonging to it.</p>

River the Towne of Cambridge in which there is a Colledge a Master and
some Number of Students belonging to it; out of which there have come
many into England, The Towne hath many great ffarmes belonging to it.

Towne reaching by y<sup>e</sup> River Side two miles, and hath belonging

the ffalls of Charles River.</p>

<p><i>Concord.</i>&mdash;Above Twelve miles above Watter Towne is an
In-land Towne called Concord It lyeth on the River Meromack I conceive
about 20 miles above the first ffalls but good passing on it there in
small Boats from place to place. They subsist in Husbandry and breeding
of Catle.</p>

<p><i>Sudbury.</i>&mdash;About 4 or 5 Miles more Southerly on the same
River is a Towne called Sudbury a very pleasant place, the River runing
to &amp; againe in it, In which I have seen Excellent ffishing both with
hooks &amp; Lynes and Netts, They plant and breed Catle, and gett
something by Tradeing w<sup>t</sup> the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Nashoway.</i>&mdash;About ten or twelfe miles aboue these Two Townes
is a Countrey Towne called Nashoway first begun for Love of the Indians
Trade, but since the ffertility of y<sup>e</sup> Soyle and pleasantness of
the River hath invited many more. There is Excellent Salmon and Trout.</p>

<p class="break">Now we must returne to the mouth of Charles River againe
or rather the entrance of the Bay of Massachusits, It hath three
entrances, two of them difficult and dangerous without a good wind and
Pylot. The Southermost called Nasascot in the usuall Channell; w<sup>in</sup>
this Bay are 12 or 13 pretty Islands between some of which yow must
saile about 2 leagues before yow come up to Boston Rode yow must passe
within halfe a Cable lenth of Castle Island, on which is a ffort above
and a strong Battery below, closs by Highwater marke, on this Island I
conceive there be thirtie good Gunns.</p>

<p><i>Boston.</i>&mdash;Two miles aboue this Island is the Towne of
Boston, the Metrapolis of New England lying pleasantly on a plaine and
the ascending of a High Mount which lyes about the midle of y<sup>e</sup>
plaine, The wholl Towne is an Island except two Hundred paces of land at
one place on the Southside it is large and very populous. It hath two
handsome Churches in it, a handsome market place, and in the midest of
it a Statehouse. In the Towne are fouer full companys of ffoote and a
Troope of horse On the Southeast side of the Towne on a little Hill
there is a Fort, and under it a Batterie both having a dozen of Gunns or
more in them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
on the Northeast side of the Towne there is a Battery of 6 Gunns
commanding the Rode and the entrance of Charles River, and on the tope
of the Hill aboue the Towne and in the strats are severall good Gunns,
The Towne is full of good shopps well furnished with all kind of
Merchandize and many Artificers, and Trad's men of all sorts. In this
Towne are kept the Courts of Election y<sup>e</sup> Generall quarter
Court besids the Country Courts.</p>

<p><i>Roxberry.</i>&mdash;About two miles to the Southward of Boston is
the Towne of Roxberry. The sea which surrounds Boston comes on both
sides of it. It is well seatted, for the Body of the Towne lyeth on both
sides a small Rivolet of water. There are many considerable ffarmes
belonging to it, and by Farmeing is there most subsistance.</p>

<p><i>Dorchester.</i>&mdash;Two miles near east from this Towne lyeth
Dorchester, which claimes the third dignity as being y<sup>e</sup> third
Towne setled by the English in the year 1630. They are a very
industrious people, and have large bounds on w<sup>ch</sup> are many
gallant Farmes, by these bounds runes the Massachusets River.</p>

<p><i>Dedham.</i>&mdash;And on Charles River stands the Towne of Dedham
about 8 Miles either from Boston or Roxberry, a very pleasant place and
the River affoords plenty of good ffish In this Towne leiveth many
Bisquett makers and Butchers and have Vent enough for their Commodities
in Boston.</p>

<p><i>Medfeild.</i>&mdash;Five or six Miles from Dedham is a small in-land
Towne called Medifield handsomly seatted for Farming and breeding of
Cattle.</p>

<p><i>Braintree.</i>&mdash;Three or fouer miles Southward is a Towne once
called Mount Wolaston, now Braintree. There was a Patent granted for a
considerable tract of land in this place in the yeare 1632 or
thereabouts to Cap<sup>t</sup> Wollaston and M<sup>r</sup> Thomas Morton.
Wollaston returned for England and Morton was banished, his house fired
before his face, and he sent prissoner to England but for what offence I
know not who some yeares after (nothing being laid to his Charge)
returned for New England, where he was soon after apprehended and keept
in the Com<span style="margin-left: -0.6em; letter-spacing: 0.15em"><small>&#175;</small>o</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.2em;">n</span> Goale a whole winter, nothing laid
to his Charge but the writeing of a Booke entituled New Canaan, which
indeed was the truest discription of New England as then it was that
euer I saw. The offence was he had touched them too neare they not
proveing the charge he was sett loose, but soone after dyed, haveing
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> he
said and most believed received his bane by hard lodging and fare in
prison. This was done by y<sup>e</sup> Massachusetts Magistrats and the
land by them disposed of. It subsists by raiseing provisions, and
furnishing Boston with wood.</p>

<p><i>Weymouth.</i>&mdash;Two or three miles from hence Sowthward is
y<sup>e</sup> Towne of Weymouth, wherein are some quantity of Inhabitants,
&amp; leive as their neibo<sup>rs</sup> who have commerce with Boston.</p>

<p><i>Higham.</i>&mdash;Three Miles from hence Easterly on the South
shoare of Massachusits Bay is the Towne of Higham a handsome Towne
supplying Boston also with wood, timber, leather and board, Some Masts
are had there and store of provisions.</p>

<p><i>Hull.</i>&mdash;Three Miles further tending more to the East, at
the very entrance into the Massachusetts Bay is the Towne of Hull, the
Inhabitants of which leives well being by Water not above 7 Miles from
Boston tho neare 20 by land.</p>

<p>Three miles South from this place is the utmost south bounds of the
Massachusits Goverment and Territories, beyond which they have not gone
although they have gone soe farr beyond them to the Northward.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Before I enter into Plymouth bounds I must say something<br />
of this Goverment which hath ouertopped all the rest.</p></div>

<p>About the yeare 1626 or 1627 there was a Patent granted by his
Maty<sup>es</sup>: Royall Father of ever blessed Memory to certaine
Gentlemen and Merchants, for the Tract of land befor menc<span
style="margin-left: -0.4em; letter-spacing: 0.2em">&#732;</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.2em;">ond</span>, and power given them by the same
to incorporate themselfes into a body pollitick the Governor and all other
officers to be Annually chosen by the Majo<sup>r</sup> part of the inhabitants,
ffreholders, As soon as the grant was confirmed, they chose here on M<sup>r</sup>
Mathew Craddock Governo<sup>r</sup> and one Goffe deputy; They forthwith sent over
one M<sup>r</sup> Endicott, Governor<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> as deputy to rule over us the
Inhabitants which had leived there long befor their Patent was granted,
and some had Patents preceeding theirs, had he had pouer according to
his will he had ruled us to y<sup>e</sup> purpose; But within two yeares
after they sent ower one M<sup>r</sup> John Winthrope Governor and with him a
Company of Assistants all <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>Chosen here in England without the
Knowledge or Consent of them that then leived there or of those which
came with them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1"
id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
This word "Governor" was interlined over the word "as," and
unfortunately no caret mark made to show its intended place.</p></div>

<p>This Governo<sup>r</sup> and his Councill, not long after their
Aryvall made a law that no man should be admitted a Freeman, and soe
Consequently have any voyce in Election of Officers Civill or Military,
but such as were first entered into Church covenant and brought
Certificate of it, let there Estates, and accordingly there portion of
land be never soe great, and there taxes towards publick Charges. Nor
could any competency of Knowledge or inoffensivenesse of liveing or
conversation usher a man into there Church ffellowship, unless he would
also acknowledge the discipline of the Church of England to be erroneous
and to renounce it, which very many never condescended unto, so that on
this account the far great Number of his Majesties loyall subjects there
never injoyed those priviledges intended by his Royall ffather in his
Grant, And upon this very accompt also, if not being Joyned in Church
ffelowship many Thowzands have been debarred the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper although of Competent knowledg, and of honest life and Godly
Conversation, and a very great Number are unbaptized. I know some neer
30 years old, 7 persons of Quality about 12 years since for petitioning
for themselves &amp; Neighbo<sup>rs</sup> that they might have votes in
Elections as ffreeholders or be ffreed from publick Charge, and be
admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper and theire Children to
Baptisme as Members of the Church of England, and have liberty to have
Ministers among themselves learned pious and Orthodox, no way dissonant
from ye best Reformation in England, and desireing alsoe to have a body
of Lawes to be Established and published to prevent Arbitrary Tiranny,
For thus desireing these three reasonable requests besids imprissonement
and other indignitys, they were fined 1000<sup>lb</sup>, a
Notw<sup>t</sup>standing they Appealled to England, they were forced to
pay the same, and now also at great Charges to send one home to
prosecute their appeall which proved to no Effect, That dismall Change
falling out, Just at that time And they sending home hither one Edward
Winslow a Smooth toungued Cunning fellow, who soon gott himselfe into
Favo<sup>r</sup> of those then in Supreame power, against whom it was in
vaine to strive, and soe they remained sufferers to this day.</p>

<p>By what I have said it appears how the Major part of the Inhabitants
are debarred of those Priviledges they ought to enjoy and were intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>fo<sup>r</sup>
them, How they Esteem of the Church of England. How farr they owne his
Matie as haveing any power over them, or their Subjection to him; This I
know that not long after they arrived they defaced the Collou<sup>rs</sup>
which they brought over with them, being the English Redd Cross terming
it a badge of the Whore of Babelon.</p>

<p>And not long after haveing received a Report that his Mat<sup>ie</sup>
intended to send a Generall Governo<sup>r</sup> over, and being informed
by a Shallop that they had seen a great shipe and a smaller one goe into
Cape Ann Harbo<sup>r</sup> about 8 Leagues from Boston. There was an Alarme
presently given and early in the Morning being Sabbath day all the
Traine Bands in Boston, and Townes adjacent were in Armes in the streets
and posts were sent to all other places to be in the same posture, in
which they continued untill by theire scouts they found her to be a
small shipe of Plymouth and a shallope that piloted her in, The generall
and Publick report was that it was to oppose the landing of an Enemie a
Governo<sup>r</sup> sent from England, and with this they acquanted the
Commanders.</p>

<p>And about the year 1636 one Brooks hearing one Evers to vilifie the
Goverment of England both Civill and Eclesiasticall, and saying that if
a Generall Governo<sup>r</sup> were sent over he would kill him if he
could, and he knew the Magistrats would bear him out in it, of which
Brooks complaining by way of Information, the matter was handled that
Evers had nothing said to him, and Brookes forced to escape privatly for
England.</p>

<p>They also in the yeare 1646 &amp; 1647 suffered a ship the Mary of
Bristoll then standing out for the Kings Majestie to be taken by one
Stagg haveing a Commission from the Parliament, and conveyed away
although they had promised them a protection. They also Ordered the
takeing downe of the Kings Armes and setting up the States, &amp; the
like by the Signe of the Kings head hanging before the doore of an Inne.
And when that unhappy warr was between King and Parlia<sup>t</sup> they
compelled every Commander of a Vessell that went out from thence to
enter into Bond not to have any Commerce with any place then holding out
for the King, and in opposition to the then pretended power in England,
Nor was there ever any Oath of Alleageance offered to any, but instead
thereof they have framed two Oathes, which they impose on those which
are made free. The other they terme the Oath of ffidelitie, which they
force all to take that are above 16 yeares of age, a Coppy of it is as
followeth&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>I. A. B. by Gods providence being an Inhabitant within the Jurisdiction
of this Comon Wealth doe freely and sincerely acknowledge myselfe to be
subject to the Goverment thereof. I doe hereby swear by the great and
dreadfull name of the ever liveing God, that I will be true and
Faithfull to the same, and will accordingly yeild assistance thereunto
with my person, Estate, as in equity I am bound And will also truly
endeavo<sup>r</sup> to maintaine and preserve all the Liberties and
priviledges thereof, Submitting myselfe unto the wholesome Lawes made
and established by the same. And further that I will not plot or
practize any evill against it or consent to any that shall soe doe. But
will timely discover and reveall the same to Lawfull Authority now here
established for the speedy preventing thereof. <span class="smcap">So Help
me God in Our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p class="break">By this it may be judged what esteeme they have of the
lawes of England, swearing theire subjects to submite to lawes made only
by themselfes, And indeed to Alleage a Statute Law of England in one of
their Courts would be a ridiculous thing. They likewise long since fell
to coyning of monies, melting downe all the English Coyne they can gett,
every shilling makeing 15<sup>d</sup> in their monies, And whereas they
went over thither to injoy liberty of Conscience, in how high a measure
have they denyed it to others there wittnesse theire debarring many from
the Sacraments spoken of before meerly because they cannot Joyne with
them in their Church-ffellowship, nor will they permitt any Lawfull
Ministers that are or would come thither to administer them. Wittness
also the Banishing so many to leave their habitations there, and seek
places abroad elswhere, meerly for differing in Judgment from them as
the Hutchinsons and severall families with them, &amp; that Honb<sup>le</sup>
Lady the Lady Deborah Moody and severalls with her meerly for declareing
themselfes moderate? Anabaptists, Who found more favour and respect
amongst the Dutch, then she did amongst the English, Many others also
upon the same account needless to be named, And how many for not comeing
to theire assemblies have been compelled to pay 5<sup>s</sup> a peece
for every Sabbath day they misse, besides what they are forced to pay
towards the mantenance of the Ministers, And very cruelly handled by
whipping and imprissonment was M<sup>r</sup> Clark, Obadiah, Holmes,
and others for teaching and praying in a private house on the Lords day,
These and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
many other such like proceedings, which would by them have been judged
Cruelty had they been inflicted on them here, have they used towards
others there; And for hanging the three Quakers last yeare I think few
approved of it.</p>

<p>There are or will come unto the Hon<sup>ble</sup> Councell many
Complaints against them, I shall say no more but come to</p>


<p class="right">
<i>The Discription of Plymouth bounds.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Connahassett.</i>&mdash;It begins where the Massachusets ends.
Three miles to the Southward of the Massachusets Bay, where (neere by
y<sup>e</sup> sea side) there stands a Village called Connahasset eight
miles further there is a small River comes out, and a reasonable harbour
at the mouth of it.</p>

<p><i>Scytuate.</i>&mdash;On both sides is a Towne called Scytuate.</p>

<p><i>Greenes-harbour.</i>&mdash;From Scituate by ye sea side is a
considerable Town called Greens Harbour, a Towne well meadowed &amp;
good farmes belonging to it. It is 7 miles from Scytuate.</p>

<p><i>Ducksbury.</i>&mdash;Seauen or eight miles from this Towne is
Ducksbury which is also a good plantation and affords much provision,
which they sell at Boston for the most part.</p>

<p><i>New Plymouth.</i>&mdash;Three or Fower miles Southward of this is
ye Towne of New Plymouth whence the Goverment took its Denomination.
This place was seated about y<sup>e</sup> yeare 1620 or 1621 by a company
of Brownists, which went formerly from England to Amsterdam, and not
beeing able to live well there, they drew in one M<sup>r</sup> Weston,
and some other Merchants in London to Transport them and their Famelies
into those Westerne parts; They intended for Virginia, but fell with
Cape Cod aìs Mallabar, and gott into the Harbour of it, and finding it
not fitt for Habitation, sought further and found this place and there
settled liveing extream hardy for some yeares and in great danger of the
Indians, and could not Long have subsisted, had not Plymouth Merchants
settled Plantations about that time at Monhegon and Pascattaway, by whom
they were supplyed and the Indians discouraged from assaulting them. It
is a poor small Towne now, The People being removed into Farmes in the
Country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sandwich.</i>&mdash;Eighteene Miles more Southerly from Plymouth
is a good Towne called Sandwich a Towne which affords good store of
Provisions, and some yeares a quantity of Whalebone made of Whales which
drive up dead in that Bay.</p>

<p><i>Barnstable.</i>&mdash;Twelve Miles from Sandwich is Barnstable a
Towne much like it and affords the same Com<span style="margin-left:
-0.6em; letter-spacing: 0.15em"><small>&#175;</small>o</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.2em;">dities.</span></p>

<p><i>Yarmouth.</i>&mdash;Seaven miles from Barnstable south east is the
Towne of Yarmouth, much like the former, and had in it as the rest have
good farmes about it, and sometimes also good benefite by drift Whales.</p>

<p><i>Billingsgate.</i>&mdash;Six miles east of this Towne is Billingsgate
which lyes in y<sup>e</sup> Southeast nooke of Cape Codd Bay, and from
thence to the Sea on the South side of the s<sup>d</sup> Cape, it is a
very litle way whereas to goe about is neare 20 Leagues which in tim
will make it more convenient for Trade.</p>

<p class="break">Almost South some what Westerly from Billingsgate is
Natuckett Island on which many Indians live and about ten leagues west
from it is Martines Vinyard, whereon many Indians live, and also
English. In this Island by Gods blissing on the Labour, care and paines
of the two Mayhews, father and sonn, the Indians are more civilized then
anywhere else which is a step to Christianity, and many of them have
attained to a greate measure of knowledge, and is hoped in a short time
some of them may with joy &amp; Comfort be received into the Bossome of
the Church, The younger of those Mayhews was drowned comeing for England
three yeares since, and the Father goes on with the worke, Although (as
I understand) they have had a small share of those vast sum<span
style="margin-left: -0.6em; letter-spacing: 0.15em"><small>&#175;</small>e</span><span
style="margin-left: -0.2em;">s</span> given for this use and purpose of
y<sup>e</sup> Revenues of it. It were good to enquire how it hath been
disposed of. I know in some measure or at least suspect the bussines
hath not been rightly carryed.</p>

<p><i>Rhode Island.</i>&mdash;From this Island to Rhode Island is about
Seaven Leagues west, This Island is about ffouerteen miles Long, in some
places 3 or 4 miles Broad, in other lesse. It is full of people haveing
been a receptacle for people of severall Sorts and Opinions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p><i>Warwick Providence.</i>&mdash;There was a Patent granted to one
Coddington for the Goverment of this Island, and Warwick and Providence
two Townes which lye on the maine, And I think they still keepe a
seeming forme of Goverment but to litle purpose, none submitting to
Supream Authority but as they please.</p>

<p><i>Rehobah.</i>&mdash;Some three miles above Providence on the same
River, is a Towne called Rehobah, and is under the Goverment of New
Plymouth, a Towne not dispicable. It is not aboue 40 Miles from Boston,
betweene which there is a Comone trade, carrying &amp; recarrying goods
by land in Cart and on Horseback, and they have a very fayre conveyance
of goods by water also.</p>

<p><i>Taunton.</i>&mdash;About ten miles from this eastward is Taunton
lying on another River within Rhode Island about 20 Miles up, It is a
pleasant place, seated amongst the Windings and turnings of a handsome
River, and hath good conveyance to Boston by Cart not being above 30
Miles assunder, here is a pretty small Iron-worke, &amp; is under New
Plymouth Government.</p>

<p><i>Pequate.</i>&mdash;Haveing gone through New Plymouth Goverment we
come next to Connecticot Goverment. The first that was under this
Goverment was Pequate, betweene w<sup>ch</sup> and Rhods Island it is
above 18 leagues,</p>

<p>In the faire Narragansitt Bay, and diverse fine Islands.</p>

<p><i>Fishers Island.</i>&mdash;Before the Pequate River lyes Fishers
Island, on which some people live, and there are store of Catle. This
Pequat Plantation will in time produce Iron, And in the country about
this is a Myne of Black Lead, and supposed there will be found better if
not already by y<sup>e</sup> industry of that ingenious Gentleman
M<sup>r</sup> John Winthrop. It hath a very good Harbour, farr Surpassing
all there about Connecticot River mouth to Pequate it is about eight
Leagues.</p>

<p><i>Saybrooke.</i>&mdash;On the South-west side of the entrance of
this River stands Saybrooke and Saybrooke Fort, a handsome place and
some Gunns in the Fort.</p>

<p><i>Metaboseck.</i>&mdash;Fifteene Leagues up the River on the same
side is the Plantation of Metaboseck, a very good place for Corne and
Catle.</p>

<p><i>Witherfeild.</i>&mdash;From Metaboseck to Withersfeild a large
&amp; Populous Towne, it is about 9 miles.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hartford.</i>&mdash;From Withersfield to Hartford the Metropolis
of the Goverment, it is about 3 Miles, it is a gallant Towne, and many
rich men in it.</p>

<p><i>Windsor.</i>&mdash;From Hartford to Windsor 9 Miles, this was the
first Towne on this River, settled first by people issueing from
Dorchester in the Massachusetts Bay about the year 1636.</p>

<p><i>Springfeild.</i>&mdash;From Windsor to Springfield about 12 miles,
and the first falles on Connecticot River are betweene these two Townes,
This is the Massachusetts bounds.</p>

<p>And above Springfeild 8 Miles is another Towne at first Intended but
for a tradeing house with the Indians, but the gallant Land about it
hath invited men to make it a Toune. This Connecticott River is a great
River before y<sup>e</sup> Towne bigger then the Thames above bridge,
This Towne is also in the Massachusetts bounds and under its Goverment
although 8 Miles from it.</p>

<p><i>Guilford.</i>&mdash;Now we must returne to the Mouth of the River
and so along by the sea side; and first from Saybrooke to Guilford 12
Miles.</p>

<p><i>Tocott.</i>&mdash;From Guilford to Tocott 9 Miles. These two Townes
are under Newhaven Goverment.</p>

<p><i>Newhaven.</i>&mdash;From Tocott to Newhaven it is 7 Miles. This
Towne is the Metropolis of that Goverment, and the Goverment tooke its
Name from this Towne; which was the first built in those parts, many
stately and costly houses were erected the Streete layd out in a Gallant
forme, a very stately Church; but y<sup>e</sup> Harbour proveing not
Comodious, the land very barren, the Merchants either dead or come away,
the rest gotten to their Farmes, The Towne is not so glorious as once it
was.</p>

<p><i>Milford.</i>&mdash;From Newhaven to Milford it is about 10 Miles,
This Towne is gotten into some way of Tradeing to Newfoundland,
Barbados, Virginia, So also hath some other Townes in this Goverment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now in Course comes in againe some<br />
Townes in Connecticott Goverment</p></div>

<p><i>Stratford.</i>&mdash;From Milford to Stratford about 4 Miles.</p>

<p><i>Fairfeild.</i>&mdash;From Stratford to Fairfeild about 8 Miles.</p>

<p><i>Norwock.</i>&mdash;From ffairfeild to Norwock about 14 Miles and
this Towne with those last named are in Connecticott Goverment. I
suppose this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
skipped over Newhaven, being they came from those Townes in Connecticott
River.</p>

<p><i>Stamford.</i>&mdash;From Norwock to Stamford 8 Miles.</p>

<p><i>Greenwich.</i>&mdash;From Stamford to Greenwich <a name="gw_p24"
id="gw_p24"></a><span class="omit">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
miles, these two last Townes are under Newhaven Goverment, and there was
another place begunn and much done in it, but the Dutch came and tooke
it by force, and since the people of this Towne call it New Chester,</p>

<p class="break">There are some Townes on Long Island which have come
some under the Goverment of Connecticot, and some of Newhaven; We are
now come about 25 Miles within the Dutch plantation, which before I
speake of I shall runn over ye plantations on Long Island, and shew
under what Goverment they are begining at the west end. The Island
conteanes in Lenth about 150 Miles, and lyes not farr from the Mayne,
especialy at the west end where it is very narrow, The plantationes are
all on the inside, the Sea board syde being a dangerous Coast and no
Harbour at all on that syde.</p>

<p>Within a few Miles of the West end over against Manhata, which is the
Dutch's Chiefe Towne is seated Gravesend, most English, the Lady Moody
being the first Setler, Some Dutch there are, and all under the Dutch
Goverment.</p>

<p>Then crossing a Bay but 12 Miles (but to round it, it is much more)
is Northampton. This Towne is under Connecticott Goverment. And then
Easthampton under no Goverment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25"
id="Page_25">25</a></span>.</p>

<p>I suppose these two Goverments of Connecticott, and Newhaven, are only
by Combination, I never heard of any Patent they have, and they are also
in Confederacie with the Massachusetts, and New Plymouth, each of these
4 Goverments annually choosen two Comissioners to meet and Consult as
occasion may serve; their power lasting for one yeare. These meettings
prove chargeable, and as it is conceived of many of no great use.</p>

<p>Tis well knowen the Dutch plantation had been taken by those two
Southerne Collonies helpe, and the English on Long Island when
Majo<sup>r</sup> Sedgwick was sent to take it who putting back for Fyall
news came by one of his Fleet that his designe was for that place; These

weeks were spent in Contest betweene the Commissioners of the two
Southerne and Northern Collonies. Those of the South Colonies were for
proceeding with expedition on the designe, The Com<span

style="margin-left: -0.2em;">ssioners</span> of the North were dayly crying out
for Orders or leave to goe on. But those of Plymouth being Mungrell
Dutch, and some of the Grandees amongst them haveing a sweet trade with
the Dutch or debts oweing to them, from them; And those of the
Massachusetts haveing some other by-reason for it so long held out the
dispute till it was to late the peace being concluded.</p>

<p>There lye between this Long Island and the Mayne severall Islands, the
most Considerable is Shelter-Island, about 8 miles in lenth and three in
breadth, This belongs to Collonell Thomas Midleton and M<sup>r</sup>
Silvester, on which they have some people &amp; store of Catle.</p>

<p>Another considerable Island lyes by it of about 6 Miles in Lenth, and
three in Breadth.</p>

<p>Now before I come to speak of Hudsons River, I shall most humbly
desire the Hon<sup>ble</sup> Councill to take it in consideration the
great benefits and profitts, which may redound to the English by these
Westerne Colonies if well managed. Of their present condition I have
given a breife accompt in my foregoing Relation, being my observations
which for severall years I have spent in America, even from the year
1624 till within these two yeares last past:</p>

<p>For Newfoundland, it is well known what a great Number of Shipps and
Seamen have been there imployed annually I dare averr it hath bredd more
Seamen then any Trade the English ever medled withall &amp; what<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> profitts
the Owners and Merchants have gott by that Trade is unvaluable, And if a
course were taken we might now have salt from the English Collonies in
the West Indies, and provision from New England to carry on a greatt
part of the designe, and on better termes then out of Europe.</p>

<p>On all the Coasts of Canada from Cape Britton to Cape Sable is Excellent
fishing and full of good Harbours.</p>

<p>On the Coast within Cape Sable, as in Nova Scotia, Port Royall, and
those other fforts now in possession of Collonel Temple is mutch Beaver
&amp; other Peltry gotten, and more might be if fully Stocked.</p>

<p>And for the Southern part of New-England, It is incredible what hath
been done there.</p>

<p>In the yeare 1626 or thereabouts there was not a Neat Beast Horse or
sheepe in the Countrey and a very few Goats or hoggs, and now it is a
wonder to see the great herds of Catle belonging to every Towne I have
mentioned, The braue Flocks of sheepe, The great number of Horses
besides those many sent to Barbados and the other Carribe Islands, And
withall to consider how many thousand Neate Beasts and Hoggs are yearly
killed, and soe have been for many yeares past for Provision in the
Countrey and sent abroad to supply Newfoundland, Barbados, Jamaica, @
other places, As also to victuall in whole or in part most shipes which
comes there.</p>

<p>Betweene the years 1626 and 1633, Indian Corne was usually sold at
10<sup>s</sup> or 12<sup>s</sup> the Bushell, now not esteemed worth
2<sup>s</sup>, Beefe and Porke then Brought from England and Irland sold
at excessive rates.</p>

<p>At that time all the Houses there, except three or fower at New
Plymouth, and those which I had could not be valued worth 200<sup>lb</sup>,
and now to behold the handsome Houses &amp; Churches in so many Townes
as I have named is a wonder, And the place in which Boston (the
Metropolis) is seated, I knew then for some yeares to be a Swamp and
Pound, now a great Towne, two Churches, a Gallant Statehouse &amp; more
to make it compleate, then can be expected in a place so late a
wilderness.</p>

<p>And wheras about the time before mentioned wee could not make in all
three Hundred men in the whole Countrey, those scattered a hundred and
ffiftie Miles assunder, Now almost every Towne which I have named is
able to bring into the feild a full Company of Foote and some Horse,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
some Townes two or three Companyes compleate with Horse proportionable
and Boston more.</p>

<p>And the great abundance of English Fruite, as Apples, Pears, Apricocks,
Plumbs, Cherries Musk-Mellons, Water-Mellons &amp;c. is not to be beleeved
but by those that have seene it.</p>

<p>And about those times also there were not within the now Great
Government of the Massachusetts above three Shallops and a few Cannoes,
Now it is wonderfull to see the many Vessels belonging to the Country of
all sorts and seizes, from Shipps of some reasonable burthen to Skiffes
and Cannoes, many other great Shipps of Burthen from 350 Tunns to 150
have been built there, and many more in time may be, And I am confident
there hath not in any place out of so small a number of People been
raised so many able Seamen and Commanders as there hath been.</p>

<p>Now we returne to Hudsons River, in the mouth of which lyeth y<sup>e</sup>
Island Mahatas, on which stands now Amsterdam in the Latitude of 41
degrees and about 41 Leagues up the River is their Fort Oranja in the
Latitude of 42 &amp; &frac12; or thereabouts.</p>

<p>I have alwayes understood that the first Setlement of the Dutch there
was about the yeare 1618, @ were then a very considerable Number, and
long after. And this was as I conceive some yeares after King James had
granted all the lands and Islands betweene the Latitude of 40 degrees to
48 North Latitude, unto a Company established at Plymouth in Devon then
nameing it New-England, so that Mahatas lyes a full degree within y<sup>e</sup>
bounds of New England; and Fort Oranja their prin<sup>l</sup> place both for
Trade with the Indians @ for Husbandry it lyeth two full degrees and an
halfe within the bounds of New England.</p>

<p>And about the year 1629 or 1630 Theire Title to it being in question
a rich ship comeing from thence was seized on at Plymouth, as some now
here can testify, which shipp and goods (as they say) was delivered up
on the Dutch relinquishment of any Title they had or might have to the
said Hudsones River And this seemes to be true, for in or about the year
1632 or 1634, a shipp set out from hence by M<sup>r</sup> Clobery &amp;
Dellabar and others for New England, with passengers &amp; goods &amp;
had also a Commission from his Mat<sup>ies</sup>: Royall Father to saile
unto Mahatas @ as farr up into the River towards Fort Oranja as they
could goe, and there trade with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">28</a></span> Natives; which they did without any opposition,
as the Masters yet liveing can testifie.</p>

<p>From the uttermost part of Hudsons River to the North Cape of Delaware
Bay, is somewhat above 20 leagues, and from this Cape to the entrance of
the River is about 12 Leagues.</p>

<p>Here the Sweedes some yeares since built a Fort and five Leauges above
that a Sconce, and three Leagues above that another Fort, and 2 Leagues
above that another.</p>

<p>And hereabout the River trends away so much easterly that betweene that
@ Hudsons River it is not above 30 Miles. In this River hath been seated
some English Familes, but outed by the Dutch or Swedes.</p>

<p>For this place there was some yeares since a Patent granted to S<sup>r</sup>
Edmund Ploydon, but by whom I know not, nor what is become of him or his
Patent.</p>

<p>The entrance of this River is in 40 degrees. And now I am come to the
utmost Southwest bounds of New England which is a Country wherein the
Rivers and Pounds affords variety of Fish and Beaver in Great abundance,
The earth brings forth plentifully all sorts of Graynes, also Hemp @
fflax, The Woods affords store of good Timber for building of shipps
Masts, Also Pitch and Tarre, The bowels of the earth yeilds excellent
Iron Oare, and no doubt other Metalls if searched after.</p>
